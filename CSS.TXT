USAGE:

Drop a file or folder on the CSS icon, or the CSS
application window & it will open a new OS/2 
command window with the working directory set to the
directory of the folder or file you dropped.
A handy utility for guys who like the WPS but just
can't totally foresake the command line!

Please report any bugs or improvements by e-mailing
me to the address above, and btw, I'm serious about
the postcard business - it really would make her
day to get a postcard or two!
